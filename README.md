# WeArePiranhaPlants
La, la, la, la,
La-da-da-da-dah!
 
Plants, plants,
We are the plants,
Now watch us sing and dance!
 
We are Piranha Plants,
We're matching one-by-one!
In a plant procession,
Marching for Piranha fun!
 
We are Piranha plants,
And 'til this song is done,
We're marching on,
Piranha Plant Parade!
Hooray!
 
I've never known-a Piranha Plants
to carry quite the tune!
(We carry quite the tune!)
Spring in our step
Singing from our stems!
 
Hear us Piranha Plants go
"Root-toot-toot-toot!"
As the march of the Piranha Plants bear fruit!
Let's holler and hoot!
Wow!
